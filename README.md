## About me

<br>

Hello, I'm Joel Jose - a third-year student pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Toc H Institute of Science and Technology, Arakkunnam.

I'm an avid supporter of FOSS and frequently contribute to open-source projects in my spare time. I'm currently learning Rust and Python, and I have also written programs in C/C++, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Java and Dart.

I use Linux-based operating systems on my laptop and server. I also have experience creating and managing virtual machines with VMware Workstation and Oracle Virtualbox, troubleshooting issues on Linux systems on the command line and configuring SOHO computer networks.

I love interacting with people who have the same passion for software engineering and open-source software as I do. Feel free to contact me via the links given below, and I look forward to hearing from you!
