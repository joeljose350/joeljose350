## About

<br>

My journey into software engineering began when I got my first laptop about a week before the first semester classes of my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering commenced.

I had learnt a little C++ in school and was looking forward to learning more about programming in college. I was busy with college work in the first semester, so I couldn't find time to learn anything outside the course curriculum.

Then COVID hit and lockdowns ensued.

During lockdowns, I spent time reading documentation and learning more about programming. I also began experimenting with Linux distributions by creating VMs and tinkering with them.

By the end of the second semester, I was comfortable working on Linux machines on the command line. I had also learnt Python by doing online courses on Coursera, followed by a data analysis project which I then uploaded to GitHub.

In the third semester, I tried learning web development and decided to build a portfolio website for myself. So, I bought a domain and began learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. By the end of the fourth semester, I decided to build the website with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

In the fifth semester, I was interested in learning Linux kernel programming and writing device drivers. Now, I'm in the sixth semester, learning C and building the portfolio website.
